                    Thanks to the internet, many people have access to education despite not having the possibility of
                    schooling, platforms like YouTube, blogs, etc.… help to create learning, however the difficulty in
                    finding precise information to what we are looking for or a guide from beginning to end on a general
                    topic like architecture, mechanics, chemistry among many, where reading, video, images are needed,
                    all this becomes difficult and the person when searching gets blocked spending a lot of time,
                    joining information from different platforms, that's why Free Learn was born, all the learning in a
                    single social network.

                    <br>A space for learners to share their study guides, learning-related information, and where
                    teachers can share various types of information, text, images, videos, live streams, surveys,
                    learning groups and a personalized learning filter, this benefits a very important industry like
